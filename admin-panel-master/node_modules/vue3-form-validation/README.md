## API

This package exports one function `useValidation`, plus some type definitions for when using TypeScript.

```ts
const { form, errors, submitting, validateFields, resetFields, add, remove } =
  useValidation<T>(formData);
```

### `useValidation` takes the following parameters:

- `formData`
  - **Type** - `object`
  - **Description** - The structure of your form data.

The form data object has a structure that is similar to any other object you would write for `v-model` data binding. The only difference being that together with every value you can provide rules to display validation errors.

Let's look at an example how the structure of some form data object can be converted to an object with the addition of rules:

```ts
const formData = {
  name: '',
  email: '',
  password: ''
};

// The above can be converted to the following
const formDataWithRules = {
  name: {
    $value: '',
    $rules: [name => !name && 'Name is required']
  },
  email: {
    $value: '',
    $rules: [email => !email && 'E-Mail is required']
  },
  password: {
    $value: '',
    $rules: [
      pw => pw.length > 7 || 'Password has to be longer than 7 characters'
    ]
  }
};
```

The form data object can contain arrays and can be deeply nested. At the leaf level, the object should contain fields whose simplified type definition looks like the following:

```ts
type Field<T> = {
  $value: Ref<T> | T;
  $rules?: Rule[];
};
```

To get better type inference while writing the `useValidation` function, it's recommended to define the structure of your data upfront and pass it as the generic parameter `T`. The type for the example above is pretty straightforward:

```ts
type FormData = {
  name: Field<string>;
  email: Field<string>;
  password: Field<string>;
};

const { ... } = useValidation<FormData>({ ... });
```

### `useValidation` exposes the following state:

- `form`
  - **Type** - `object`
  - **Description** - Transformed form data object.
- `submitting`
  - **Type** - `Ref<boolean>`
  - **Description** - `True` during validation after calling `validateFields`.
- `errors`
  - **Type** - `ComputedRef<string[]>`
  - **Description** - Array of all current validation error messages.

`Form` is a reactive object with identical structure as the form data input
but with added metadata to every field.
Every object with a `$value` property will be converted to an object of the following type:

```ts
type TransformedField<T> = {
  $uid: number;
  $value: T;
  $errors: string[];
  $hasError: boolean;
  $validating: boolean;
  $onBlur(): void;
};
```

Given the structure of the previous example, this will result in the following:

```ts
type Form = {
  name: TransformedField<string>;
  email: TransformedField<string>;
  password: TransformedField<string>;
};
```

As you may have noticed, all of the properties are prefixed with the `$` symbol, which is to distinguish them from other properties but also to avoid naming conflicts. Below is a description of all the properties and their use case:

- `$uid`
  - **Type** - `number`
  - **Description** - Unique identifier of the field. For dynamic forms this can be used as the `key` attribute in `v-for`.
- `$value`
  - **Type** - `T`
  - **Description** - The `modelValue` of the field, which is meant to be used together with `v-model`.
- `$errors`
  - **Type** - `string[]`
  - **Description** - Array of validation error messages local to this field.
- `$hasError`
  - **Type** - `boolean`
  - **Description** - `True` while there are validation errors.
- `$validating`
  - **Type** - `boolean`
  - **Description** - `True` while at least one rule is validating.
- `$onBlur`
  - **Type** - `function`
  - **Description** - Function which will mark this field as touched. When a field has been touched, it will validate all it's rules after every input. Before it will not do any validation.

### `useValidation` exposes the following methods:

- `validateFields(names?: any[]) -> Promise`
  - **Description** - Validate all fields or pass an array to select specific ones.
  - **Parameters**
    - `names?` - Field names to validate.
  - **Returns** - A `Promise` which will reject if there are validation errors, and resolve with the form data otherwise. The error in the rejected `Promise` will be of type `ValidationError`.
- `resetFields(formData?: object) -> void`
  - **Description** - Reset all fields to their original value, or pass an object to set specific values.
  - **Parameters**
    - `formData?` - Values to use when resetting (see [Sandbox examples](https://codesandbox.io/s/vue-3-form-validation-demo-7mp4z?file=/src/views/SignupForm.vue)).
- `add(path: (string | number)[], value: any) -> void`
  - **Description** - Function for writing dynamic forms (similar to [Lodash's set function](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#set)).
  - **Parameters**
    - `path` - The path of the property to add.
    - `value` - The value to add (fields will be transformed as shown above).
- `remove(path: (string | number)[]) -> void`
  - **Description** - Function for writing dynamic forms.
  - **Parameters**
    - `path` - The path of the property to remove. For example `remove(['as', 0])` will remove the first element in an array called `as` at the root level.

## Writing Rules

Rules are functions that should return a `string` when the validation fails. They can be written purely as a function or together with a `key` property in an object.
They can also alternatively return a `Promise` when you have a rule that requires asynchronous code.

**Typing:**

```ts
type SimpleRule<T = any> = (value: T) => any;
type KeyedRule = {
  key: string;
  rule?: (...values: any[]) => any;
};
type Rule<T = any> = SimpleRule<T> | KeyedRule;
```

Keyed rules that share the same `key` will be executed together. This can be useful in a situation where rules are dependent on another, such as the `Password` and `Confirm Password` fields in a [Register Form](https://codesandbox.io/s/vue-3-form-validation-demo-7mp4z?file=/src/views/SignupForm.vue).
Rules will always be called with the latest `modelValue`.
Simple rules will only receive their own argument, whereas keyed rules will also receive every other `modelValue` with a matching key.

> To prevent overly aggressive error messages, keyed rules will only be called
> after all fields with connected rules have been touched.

To determine if a call should result in an error, it will check if the rule's return value is of type `string`. There are no build-in rules included in this package, as implementation details may differ across applications. However, here is an example of how some generic rules might look like:

`rules.js`
```ts
export const required = msg => x => !x && msg;
export const min = min => msg => x => x.length >= min || msg;
export const max = max => msg => x => x.length <= max || msg;
export const minMax = (min, max) => msg => x =>
  (min <= x.length && x.length <= max) || msg;
export const email = msg => x => /\S+@\S+\.\S+/.test(x) || msg;
export const equal = msg => (...xs) => xs.every(x => x === xs[0]) || msg;
```

You can put these in a separate file and use them wherever you need. Placing the `modelValue` (here `x`) as the last argument of the function chain gives you a concise syntax when using them together with `useValidation`:

```ts
useValidation({
  someField: {
    $value: '',
    rules: [
      required('Your message'),
      min(3)('Your message'),
      max(8)('Your message'),
      minMax(5, 20)('Your message'),
      email('Your message'),
      equal('Your message')
    ]
  }
})
```
Async rules allow you to perform network requests, for example checking if a username exists in the database. The same principle applies as for synchronous rules, `resolve` or `reject` with a string if the validation fails:

```ts
const isNameTaken = name =>
  new Promise(resolve => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      if (['Alice', 'Bob'].includes(name)) {
        resolve();
      } else {
        resolve('This name is already taken');
      }
    }, 2000);
  });
```

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter errors while building, you may have to install a TypeScript **version >= 4.1**
